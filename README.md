This file serves as a template for armips assembler that allows to create Mario Kart DS ASM hacks with variable sizes of ARM9.bin.

*Armips* assembler programmed by Kingcom can be found under this link:
[https://github.com/Kingcom/armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips)

This isn't the only method of assembling custom code for Mario Kart DS (either an old version of Gericom's [*MKDS Course Modifier*](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1285/) or Dirbaio's [*NSMBe*](https://nsmbhd.net/download/) can be used), but this template can ensure that your code will become compatible with a cross-platform tool in active development. 

The bare template does not require any additional packages, which makes it a lightweight and easy solution. Building object files in C however requires compilation for an ARM platform with a compiler such as arm-none-eabi-gcc or, for perfect compatibility, Nintendo's in-house compiler in Metrowerks's *CodeWarrior* package (*mwccarm* version 2).

------------------

Due to the way Autoload Tables are being generated by this script, a minimal length of a custom data section **0x20** is necessary for the script to work correctly.

Every time an instruction in the script is commented out, script needs to run on original ARM9.bin again.
